### 📖 The Story Behind the Code

I’m **Ephrem Ageru**, a software engineering student at Girne American University (GAU) and a passionate web developer based in Kyrenia, Cyprus. 

For me, software development is not just an academic requirement or a 9-to-5 job—it is an absolute craft. I approach writing code the same way a producer approaches making music (I'm a massive Eminem fan). Every function needs rhythm, every database query needs structure, and the final user interface needs a flow that feels entirely natural to the user. 

I build complete web platforms from the ground up. I don't just piece together templates; I engineer custom solutions that solve real-world problems.

### ⚙️ My Tech Stack & Expertise

I consider myself a **Frontend Specialist with a Full-Stack reality check**. I deeply understand that a beautiful interface is completely useless if the backend is fragile. Here is how I approach the technology I use every day:

The server-side is where the real heavy lifting happens. I specialize in custom **PHP** development, writing clean, structured, and object-oriented code. Instead of relying heavily on bloated frameworks, I know how to build secure authentication systems, custom REST APIs, and dynamic content management systems (CMS) entirely from scratch. 

When it comes to data, I design relational **MySQL** databases focused on absolute integrity and speed. I normalize data structures to prevent redundancy, write highly optimized relational queries, and strictly enforce security measures against vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

The frontend is where logic meets human emotion. I focus heavily on writing semantic **HTML5** and modern **CSS3** (using **Tailwind** and **Bootstrap**) to create pixel-perfect, responsive layouts that adapt flawlessly to any device. 

Using modern **JavaScript (ES6+)** and **React**, I bring these interfaces to life. I focus on DOM manipulation, state management, and asynchronous data fetching to ensure the user experience is interactive and lightning-fast. I obsess over the small details—smooth transitions, intuitive navigation, and clean typography.

I take my projects from local development straight to live production environments. I am highly comfortable managing **cPanel** servers, configuring domains, managing SSL certificates, and using **Git/GitHub** for reliable version control.

### 🚀 Real-World Platforms I've Built

I learn by building real businesses. Here are two platforms I designed, coded, and deployed entirely on my own:

| 🏠 [TRNC Rent](https://trncrent.com) | 🎓 [ScholarshipHub](https://scholarshiphub.website) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Founder & Lead Developer**<br>A comprehensive property rental platform built for Northern Cyprus. I engineered the entire system to handle dynamic property listings, image galleries, and secure contact routing. | **Lead Developer**<br>A dynamic discovery platform helping students track down local and international scholarship opportunities without the clutter of standard search engines. |
| Built a custom **PHP admin panel** so non-technical users can manage listings effortlessly, bypassing the need for heavy CMS frameworks like WordPress. | Features automated category management, strict deadline tracking, featured listings, and a highly optimized **MySQL database** structure for fast load times. |
